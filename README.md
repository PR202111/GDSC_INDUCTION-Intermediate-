## Tasks Completed

### 1. MNIST Digit Classification
- Implemented a **digit classification pipeline** using the MNIST dataset.
- Built a model that takes an image as input and outputs the predicted digit.
- Focused on understanding the **data flow, preprocessing, and inference pipeline**.

### 2. Predicting Hostel Wi-Fi Speed
- Explored internet usage data to identify **peak usage hours and congestion patterns**.
- Engineered features like:
  - Hour of day
  - Session intensity
  - Average transfer rate
- Built a **regression model** to predict Wi-Fi speed/load.
- Visualized predictions vs actual values and highlighted worst-case peak hours.
- Suggested optimal times for heavy downloads or binge-watching.
